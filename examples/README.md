## Calculation Processes

All structures have been relaxed, you only need to complete the following steps:


For VASP and Quantum-Espresso Users:
1. Static calculation (SCF).
2. Static calculation (non-SCF).
3. Calculate Total, Condensed and Local Fermi-Softness.


For CP2K Users:
1. Single point energy calculation.
2. Calculate Total, Condensed and Local Fermi-Softness.
