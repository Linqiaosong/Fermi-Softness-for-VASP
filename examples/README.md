# Examples

## Calculation Processes

All structures have been relaxed, you only need to complete the following steps:

1. Static calculation (SCF).
2. Static calculation (non-SCF), read CHGCAR generated from SCF.
3. For insulators, you also need to calculate the band structure to obtain the eigenvalues of VBM and CBM. (Optional)
4. Calculate Total, Condensed and Local Fermi-Softness.
